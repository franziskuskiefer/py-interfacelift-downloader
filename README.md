_(This branch is a slight experiment. Since wget is executed with the -nc option there is no need to check if the file exists from within Python. only one wget command is executed with a list of files instead of one wget per file. This enables the use of --wait and --random-wait. Since this, the subprocess module has been utilized instead of os.system().)_

Py-Interfacelift-downloader
===========================

This snippets downloads wallapers from Interfacelift according to the preferences set. To specify which images you want, edit the `urlspec` string. For now it looks like this:

    urlspec = 'rating/widescreen/1920x1200/'

This will sort the pictures by rating, chooses the widscreen format and further specifies a resolution of 1920x1200. In general the urlspec looks something like this:

    urlspec = 'sort/format/resolution'

where

* `sort` can instead be e.g. `date` or `downloads`
* `format` can instead be e.g. `fullscreen`, `hdtv` 
* `resolution` can instead  be e.g. `1280x1024` or `1080p`

Check how the URL changes when you select the options in Interfacelift itself.

To specify where to save the images, edit the `directory` string. Please leave `expanduser('~')` as it is (unless you now what you're doing) and rather edit the string after the `+` sign. Start the string with `/` and choose the folder you want. If it doesn't exists, `wget` will create it.

To specify how many pictures you want, edit the `range()` function. To download the pictures from the _n_ first pages, change it to read `range(1,n+1)`. This will download 10 _n_ images.

The regex pattern matches any string which:

* Is preceeded by `<a href="/wallpaper/`
* contains any amount of any characters
* ends in `.jpg`
* preceeds `">`

I think this is enough to filter out only the wanted links. Note that the matched string will include the random part of the URL so that you don't have to specify it manually. If this script stops working at some point, this regex is probably what needs to be changed.
